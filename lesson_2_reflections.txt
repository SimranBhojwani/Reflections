What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	when we initialize the git repository it maintains a hidden file that tracks down the changes that were made in the file and also keeps records of all the commits that were made.
	we need to do this for using git version control.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	repository has all the files
	working directory has the files on which we are working in current project
	staging area has the files in which changes were made and are ready to be commited as a 
	single logical commit.
