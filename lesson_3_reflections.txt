When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  we can't carry laptop /pc all the time so what if we need our files at our office or college where we dont have our local 
  computer so to access files at that time we need our files to be uploaded to remote repository from where we can access all the
  files and no need to carry your files explicitly in pendrive.
